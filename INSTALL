Requirements
------------

GOSS uses CMake for configuration and installation. GOSS also
relies on a number of other third-party libraries. Your system will be
probed for these libraries as part of the configuration process.

Packages:

  cmake, libboost, swig

Simple build and install
------------------------

In the simplest case, just issue the commands

  cmake .
  make install

This will first configure GOSS for your system and then compile and
install GOSS in your system's default installation direcory, for
example in /usr/local/ or /opt/local/.

Local installation
------------------

It may sometimes be advantageous to install GOSS locally as part
of the GOSS source tree. To do this, simply type

  ./cmake.local

This configures, compiles, and install GOSS in a directory named
'local' in the GOSS source tree.

Customized builds
-----------------

To customize the configuration of GOSS, it is convenient to use one
of the graphical user interfaces for CMake, such as either ccmake or
cmake-gui. These frontends to CMake allow simple manipulation of
variables that control the configuration of GOSS.

It is often useful to build GOSS 'out-of-source' which means that
all files generated by the build process end up in a separate
directory without cluttering the source tree. To make an out-of-source
build for GOSS using a graphical interface to CMake, simply type

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake-gui ..
  make install

Building tests
--------------

Tests are built by default. To run all tests do

  make tests

GOSS uses ctest. To run specific tests with full output

  ctest -V -R ode

where ode is a particular test
